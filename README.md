# Supermarket-Sales-Analysis-ML
Supermarket Sales Analysis and ML Project
Overview
This project analyzes supermarket transaction data collected over a two-year period using advanced data engineering techniques and machine learning models. The goal is to extract valuable business insights and develop predictive models for sales forecasting and customer behavior analysis.

Key Features
Data cleaning and preprocessing of sales, item, promotion, and supermarket location datasets

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations

Feature engineering for machine learning models

Implementation of supervised learning models (Random Forest, XGBoost) for sales prediction

Reinforcement learning model for maze navigation as an additional challenge

Project Structure
data_engineer_test_Final.py: Main script containing data processing and model implementation

Data-report.pdf: Detailed report of the analysis and findings

Feature_model.ipynb: Jupyter notebook with feature engineering and model development

maze_navigation_report.pdf: Report on the reinforcement learning maze navigation challenge

Technologies Used
Python

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn

XGBoost

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Stable-baselines3 (for reinforcement learning)

Key Insights
